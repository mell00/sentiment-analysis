# sentiment-analysis
A sentiment analysis script that analyzes the sentiment of text data, such as social media posts or product reviews, and provides a sentiment score or classification.

I plan to write additional scripts that export the sentiment scores for each category (Positive, Neutral, and Negative) into R, and return a probability distribution that estimates the likelihood of the text belonging to each sentiment category.
